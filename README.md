# Paper Golf

This is the repository for a mini golf platformer I am working on for school.

You can play the (quite scuffed) game [here](https://rlft09.github.io/PaperGolf/).

 # Recent Updates:

 * fully completed volleyball dummy boss fight
 * final boss is now playable, kind of
 * you can now reach the end of the game, there isn't any obstacles though.

# Controls:
Enter: shoots the golfball
Mouse: Plays the game

These following controls are for testing purposes only:

F10: Activates debug mode
F7: Loads the level
F4: Loads a currently unused area, if accidently pressed, just press F7
F3: Activates freecam
